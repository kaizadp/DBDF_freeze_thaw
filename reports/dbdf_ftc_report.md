DBDF-FTC incubations
================

## Experiment

O and B horizon soils were collected from the Dwight B. Demerritt
Forest. Sieved (6 mm/2 mm) and homogenized.  
The soil was weighed into Mason jars and subjected to one of four
treatments (experimental replication n = 5):

1.  FTC-1: frozen continuously with one 24-hour thaw period
2.  FTC-2: frozen continuously with two 24-hour thaw periods
3.  FTC-6: frozen continuously with six 24-hour thaw periods
4.  control: continuously kept at +5 C

Incubations lasted 6 weeks (42 days) total.

Frozen conditions were -10 C, thaw conditions were +5 C

Subsamples were collected from the soils before and after the
incubation, for chemistry analysis.

Respiration (CO2 flux) was measured on all samples before and after the
incubation, and on FTC-6 soils during a few thaw periods. The jars were
sealed for 60 minutes, and 10-mL headspace samples were collected with a
syringe at 0, 20, 40, 60 minute intervals.
